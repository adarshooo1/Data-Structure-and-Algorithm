What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
This technique is used in many algorithms and data structures to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller,
simpler versions of themselves.


Prerequisites?

Functions and Memory Management(Heap Memory and Stack Memory).

Why do we use Recursion:
1.To solve the bigger /complex problem in a simple way like breaking down them.
2.We can convert recursion solution into iteration & Vice-Versa.
3.Space Complexity in not constant because of recursive calls.
