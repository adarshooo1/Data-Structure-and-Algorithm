Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly
dividing the array in half and checking if the element being searched for is in the left or right half of the array.
The algorithm starts by checking the middle element of the array. If the element is equal to the one being searched for,
the algorithm returns the index of that element. If the element is less than the one being searched for, the algorithm
repeats the process on the right half of the array. If the element is greater than the one being searched for, the
algorithm repeats the process on the left half of the array.
