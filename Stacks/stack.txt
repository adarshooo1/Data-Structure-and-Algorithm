A Stacks is a class.

A Stacks is a linear data structure in Java that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle,
meaning the last element pushed onto the stack will be the first one to be popped off.
It has operations such as push, pop, and peek. It can be implemented using an Array or Linked List.

Removal is knows as pop
Insertion is known as push

Example of a Stacks:-In a sack what we put first or add first, get removed in last.
or, a can of Rice what we put first take it out at very last.

This is also known as abstract datatype we just using it from outside don't know its internal implementation.
